# **SELF-LEARNING GUIDE: DATA STRUCTURES & ALGORITHMS (INSTRUCTION)**

Target Audience: Intern Developer/Data Engineer  
Format: Self-learning (Independent Research) & Mentor Review  
Duration: 4 hours/session

## **I. TRAINING PHILOSOPHY & METHODOLOGY**

This program does not follow a "spoon-feeding" approach. We provide **keywords**, **scope**, and **problems**. Your task is to:

1. **Research:** Use AI (ChatGPT, Gemini...) to explain concepts. Use Google/Docs to verify information.
2. **Synthesize:** Summarize knowledge in your own understanding (Mindmap, Notes).
3. **Experiment:** Perform **Mini Labs** (separate file) to verify theories immediately.
4. **Practice:** Apply knowledge to solve problems in **Assignments** (separate file).

### **Daily Report Structure (Deliverables)**

At the end of each session, you must submit a report to your Mentor using the following template:

**REPORT: [Session Name] - [Date]**

**1. Summary of Learning:**

- Summary of learned concepts (Mindmap/Bullet points).

**2. Mini-Labs Results:**

- Screenshots or code snippets of Lab results.
- Brief comments (e.g., "Recursion uses more stack memory because...").

**3. Assignment Progress:**

- Report on Assignment progress (Current task, % completion).

**4. Issues & Q&A:**

- Problems encountered.
- Questions requiring Mentor's explanation, **at least 2**.

- **Array vs LL:** "Why does inserting into an Array take O(n) but inserting into a Linked List take O(1) (given the node reference)?"
- **Dynamic Array:** "Explain why Dynamic Arrays (like Java ArrayList) need to copy all elements to a new array when resizing."
- **Stack:** "Visualize how a Stack works using the 'Back' button in a web browser as an example."
- **Queue:** "Compare Queue vs Stack: When would I use one over the other? Give 3 examples for each."
- **Recursion:** "Trace the execution of `factorial(5)` and show how the Call Stack grows and shrinks."
- **Recursion Error:** "Explain the concept of 'Stack Overflow' error using a recursive function without a base case."
- **Binary Search:** "Simulate a Binary Search on the sorted array `[2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56]` searching for 23. List the index comparisons."
- **Memory:** "What is a 'Memory Leak' in the context of a Linked List? How do modern Garbage Collectors handle it?"

_Action:_ Complete **Session 1 Labs** in Mini Labs.md.

### **SESSION 2: ASSIGNMENT 1 (LINEAR SCOPE)**

- **Focus:** Complete **Assignment 01** in the Assignments file.
  - **Part 1:** Implement Dynamic Array & Linked List from scratch.

### **SESSION 3: THEORY - NON-LINEAR STRUCTURES & ADVANCED ALGORITHMS**

**Goal:** Master Hashing, Sorting, Trees, and Optimization strategies.

#### **1. Scope**

- **Hash-based DS:**
  - Set vs Map concepts.
  - Hash Function & Collision Resolution.
- **Sorting Algorithms:**
  - Logic of Merge Sort & Quick Sort.
  - Stable vs Unstable sorting.

  - Top-K elements using Heap.

#### **2. Instruction: How to leverage AI/Web**

Sample prompts to explore the concepts deeply:

- **Synthesis (Review):** "Create a Decision Tree for choosing between Hash Map, BST, and Heap based on needs (e.g., 'Need unique keys?', 'Need sorted order?', 'Need priority access?')."
- **Hashing:** "Explain the 'Pigeonhole Principle' in the context of Hash Map collisions."
- **Collision Resolution:** "Explain how a Hash Map handles collisions using Chaining vs Open Addressing. What are the pros and cons?"
- **Time Complexity:** "Why is access time in a HashMap O(1) commonly, but O(n) in the worst case?"
- **Sorting:** "Compare Merge Sort and Quick Sort: Which one is 'Stable'? Why does stability matter when sorting objects?"
- **Quick Sort:** "Visualize the process of partitioning in Quick Sort with the array `[10, 80, 30, 90, 40, 50, 70]` using the last element as pivot."
- **Tree Visualization:** "Draw a Binary Search Tree (BST) after inserting these numbers in order: `10, 5, 15, 3, 7, 18`."
- **Tree Traversal:** "Generate code for an In-Order Traversal of a Binary Tree. What is the property of the output sequence if the tree is a BST?"
