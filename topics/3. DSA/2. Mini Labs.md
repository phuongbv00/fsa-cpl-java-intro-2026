# **MINI LABS: QUICK PRACTICE EXERCISES**

Purpose: Small, isolated labs to help you verify the theories learned in the Instruction file before applying them to the large project.  
Requirement: After completing each lab, take a screenshot or save the code snippet to include in your daily report.

### **SESSION 1 LABS: LINEAR STRUCTURES & CORE ALGORITHMS**

**Lab 1.1 (Big-O Analysis):**

- **Task:** Write 3 simple methods/functions in your preferred language (C++, Java, Python, JS, ...):
  1. Print the first element of an array/list.
  2. Loop through the array and print all elements.
  3. Nested loop to print all pairs of elements.
- **Requirement:** Add comments explaining the Time Complexity (Big-O) of each function.

**Lab 1.2 (Stack Implementation):**

- **Task:** Implement a Fixed-Size Stack struct/class using a primitive Array.
- **Requirement:** Support `push(element)`, `pop()`, `peek()`. Handle "Stack Overflow" (full) and "Stack Underflow" (empty).

**Lab 1.3 (Linked List Visualization):**

- **Task:** Draw the process of deleting a node from the _middle_ of a Singly Linked List.
- **Question:** What references/pointers need to be updated? What happens to the deleted node (memory deallocation vs garbage collection)?

**Lab 1.4 (Binary Search):**

- **Task:** Implement Binary Search on a sorted array of integers.
- **Requirement:** Return index if found, else -1 (or distinct "not found" value). Compare step count vs Linear Search.

**Lab 1.5 (Recursion Stack Trace):**

- **Task:** Write a recursive function to calculate `Factorial(n)`.
- **Practice:** Add print statements to console (e.g., "Enter n=..." / "Return ...") to observe the LIFO nature of the Call Stack.

### **SESSION 3 LABS: NON-LINEAR STRUCTURES & ADVANCED ALGORITHMS**

**Lab 3.1 (Hash Collision Simulation):**

- **Task:** Simulate a Hash Table with size 5 manually. Keys: [10, 15, 20, 12, 7]. Logic: `Key % 5` (or equivalent modulo).
- **Question:** Which keys collide? Draw the structure if using Chaining (Linked List at bucket).

**Lab 3.2 (Merge Sort Trace):**

- **Task:** Given array `[38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]`.
- **Requirement:** Write down steps of "Divide" phase until single elements, then "Conquer" phase (Merging back).

**Lab 3.3 (BST Traversal):**

- **Task:** Draw a Binary Search Tree (BST) with inserted order: 50, 30, 20, 40, 70, 60, 80.
- **Practice:** Write down the **In-Order Traversal** output. Is the sequence sorted?

**Lab 3.4 (Priority Queue / Heap):**

- **Task:** Use your language's Standard Library Priority Queue (e.g., `PriorityQueue` in Java, `heapq` in Python, `priority_queue` in C++).
- **Practice:** Insert: 10, 5, 20, 2. Remove repeatedly.
- **Observation:** Confirm elements come out in sorted order (Ascending or Descending).

**Lab 3.5 (Space Complexity Analysis):**

- **Task:** Analyze Space Complexity of a recursive function that goes `N` deep.
- **Question:** Why is it O(N) even if we don't declare new variables in the body?
