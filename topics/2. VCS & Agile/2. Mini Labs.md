# **MINI LABS: GIT & AGILE QUICK PRACTICE**

Purpose: Small, isolated labs to help you verify the theories learned in the Instruction file before applying them to the long assignment.  
Requirement: After completing each lab, save the terminal output or take a screenshot to include in your daily report.

### **SESSION 1: GIT FUNDAMENTALS LABS**

**Lab 1.1 (The Three Stages):**

* **Task:** Initialize a repo and move a file through the three stages.
* **Steps:** 
    1. Create a folder `git-lab-1` and run `git init`.
    2. Create `note.txt`. Run `git status`. (Identify it's in the Working Tree).
    3. Run `git add note.txt`. Run `git status`. (Identify it's in the Staging Area).
    4. Run `git commit -m "Initial commit"`. Run `git log`. (Identify it's in the Local Repo).
* **Question:** What happens to `git status` after the commit?

**Lab 1.2 (Branching & Fast-forward):**

* **Task:** Create a branch and perform a fast-forward merge.
* **Steps:**
    1. Create a new branch `feature-a`.
    2. Switch to `feature-a`, add a new line to `note.txt`, and commit.
    3. Switch back to `main`.
    4. Merge `feature-a` into `main`.
* **Observation:** Look at the output of `git merge`. Does it say "Fast-forward"?

**Lab 1.3 (Git Ignore):**

* **Task:** Use `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive or unnecessary files.
* **Steps:**
    1. Create a file `secret.env` and a folder `logs/`.
    2. Create a `.gitignore` file and add `secret.env` and `logs/` to it.
    3. Run `git status`. Are these files being tracked?

### **SESSION 3: COLLABORATION & UNDO LABS**

**Lab 3.1 (Merge Conflict):**

* **Task:** Manually create and resolve a conflict.
* **Steps:**
    1. In `main` branch, change line 1 of `note.txt` to "Hello from Main" and commit.
    2. Create and switch to branch `conflict-test`.
    3. Change line 1 of `note.txt` to "Hello from Conflict" and commit.
    4. Switch back to `main` and try to merge `conflict-test`.
* **Requirement:** Resolve the conflict by keeping both lines, then complete the merge.

**Lab 3.2 (Revert vs Reset):**

* **Task:** Undo a commit using two different methods.
* **Steps:**
    1. Make a "bad commit" and realize you want to undo it.
    2. Use `git revert HEAD` and observe `git log`. (Is the bad commit still there?)
    3. Make another "bad commit".
    4. Use `git reset --hard HEAD~1`. (What happened to the file changes and the commit?)

**Lab 3.3 (Agile Planning - User Stories):**

* **Task:** Write 3 User Stories for a "Simple Calculator" app.
* **Format:** "As a [user], I want to [action] so that [benefit]".
* **Requirement:** Include at least one Acceptance Criterion for each story.
