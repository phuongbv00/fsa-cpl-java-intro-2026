# **PROJECT ASSIGNMENTS: GIT WORKFLOW & AGILE SIMULATION**

Context:  
You are working on a simple project called "My Portfolio". You will use Git to manage source code and Agile/Scrum to manage tasks.

---

## **ASSIGNMENT 01: GIT FLOW FOUNDATION**

*(For Session 1 & 2)*

Duration: 4 hours  
Objectives: Master local Git operations, branching, and remote synchronization.

### **Part 1: Local Repository & Commit Convention**

**Requirement:**
1. Create a local folder `my-portfolio` and initialize it with Git.
2. Create an `index.html` file with basic content.
3. **Commit Convention:** Perform at least 5 commits as you build a simple HTML structure. Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:
    * `feat: add header and navigation`
    * `feat: add about me section`
    * `fix: correct typo in contact info`
    * etc.

### **Part 2: Branching & Remote**

**Requirement:**
1. Create a GitHub or GitLab account (if you don't have one).
2. Create a **Remote Repository** named `my-portfolio`.
3. Link your local repo to the remote and `push` the `main` branch.
4. **Branching Practice:**
    * Create a branch named `feature/contact-form`.
    * Add a contact form to your HTML file on this branch and commit.
    * Push this branch to the remote.
    * Merge `feature/contact-form` into `main` locally and push `main`.

**Deliverables:**
* Link to your Public Repository.
* Screenshot of `git log --oneline --graph --all`.

## **ASSIGNMENT 02: AGILE COLLABORATION (TEAMWORK)**

*(For Session 3 & 4)*

Duration: 4 hours  
Objectives: Simulate an Agile team workflow using GitHub Issues/Projects and Pull Requests.

### **Part 0: Team Formation**

**Requirement:**
1. Form a team of **3–4 members**.
2. Elect a **Scrum Master** (responsible for the board) and a **Product Owner** (responsible for stories). All members act as Developers.
3. Choose one member's `my-portfolio` repository (from Assignment 01) to be the "Team Repo" or create a new one. Add all members as **Collaborators**.

### **Part 1: Mini Backlog (Agile Planning)**

**Requirement:**
1. Use **GitHub Projects** (or Trello/Jira) to create a mini-backlog for your portfolio.
2. Create 3–5 **User Stories** (Tasks). Example:
    * *As a visitor, I want to see a list of projects so I can evaluate the owner's skills.*
    * *As the owner, I want a footer with social media links.*
3. Define **Definition of Done (DoD)** for your tasks (e.g., Code committed, Branch merged, Self-reviewed).

### **Part 2: Collaboration Workflow (Git Flow)**

**Requirement:** For each task in your backlog, follow this workflow:
1. **Assign** the task to a team member and move it to "In Progress".
2. **Create a branch** from `main`: `feature/story-id-description`.
3. **Implement** the feature and commit.
4. **Push** the branch and create a **Pull Request (PR)** on GitHub.
5. **Code Review:** Another team member MUST review the code, leave at least 2 comments/suggestions, and then **Approve** the PR.
6. **Merge PR:** Use "Squash and merge" or "Create a merge commit".
7. **Link:** Ensure your PR description contains "Closes #1" (linking to the Issue/Task).
8. **Simulate Conflict:** In this session, specifically simulate a "Many-to-One" conflict:
    * All members edit the **same line** in the **same file** (e.g., `README.md` or a `shared-styles.css`) on their respective branches.
    * The first person merges successfully.
    * The subsequent members MUST resolve the conflict before their PRs can be merged.

### **Part 3: Conflict Resolution Guidance**

When multiple members update the same file, conflicts are inevitable. Follow these methods:

1.  **Method 1: Local Merge Resolution**
    *   Switch to your feature branch.
    *   Pull the latest changes from `main`: `git pull origin main`.
    *   Git will signal a conflict. Open the file in your IDE.
    *   Choose: *Accept Current*, *Accept Incoming*, or *Merge Both*.
    *   `git add`, `git commit`, and `push` again.
2.  **Method 2: Rebase (Cleaner History)**
    *   `git checkout feature/your-branch`
    *   `git rebase main`
    *   Resolve conflicts at each commit.
    *   `git push --force` (Use with caution in teams).

**Deliverables:**
* Link to the Team's GitHub Project board.
* Links to at least 4 closed Pull Requests (from different members).
* A short text file `reflection.md` (one per team) explaining:
    * **Conflict Report:** Describe the "Many-to-One" conflict simulation. Who merged first? How did others resolve it? Which method was used?
    * The value of **Code Review** in a team environment.
    * How Agile events (like a mini-Daily Standup) helped keep the team on track.
