# **SELF-LEARNING GUIDE: VCS & AGILE FUNDAMENTALS (INSTRUCTION)**

Target Audience: Intern Developer  
Format: Self-learning (Independent Research) & Mentor Review  
Duration: 4 hours/session

## **I. TRAINING PHILOSOPHY & METHODOLOGY**

This program does not follow a "spoon-feeding" approach. We provide **keywords**, **scope**, and **problems**. Your task is to:

1. **Research:** Use AI (ChatGPT, Gemini...) to explain concepts. Use Google/Docs to verify information.  
2. **Synthesize:** Summarize knowledge in your own understanding (Mindmap, Notes).  
3. **Experiment:** Perform **Mini Labs** (separate file) to verify theories immediately.  
4. **Practice:** Apply knowledge to a real-world project in **Assignments** (separate file).

### **Daily Report Structure (Deliverables)**

At the end of each session, you must submit a report to your Mentor using the following template:

**REPORT: [Session Name] - [Date]**

**1. Summary of Learning:**

* Summary of learned concepts (Mindmap/Bullet points).

**2. Mini-Labs Results:**

* Screenshots or terminal outputs of Git commands.  
* Brief comments (e.g., "Difference between reset --soft and --hard is...").

**3. Assignment Results:**

* Report on Assignment progress (Current task, % completion).
* Links to repository, Pull Requests, or screenshots of Agile boards.

**4. Issues & Q&A:**

* Problems encountered.
* Questions requiring Mentor's explanation, **at least 3**.

## **II. LEARNING ROADMAP & KNOWLEDGE SCOPE**

### **SESSION 1: GIT FUNDAMENTALS & LOCAL WORKFLOW**

**Goal:** Understand the Git mental model and master basic local commands.

#### **1. Scope (Key Knowledge Areas)**

* **Version Control Fundamentals:**
    * Why VCS? Centralized (SVN) vs Distributed (Git).
    * Git mental model: Commit (Snapshot), Branch (Pointer), HEAD.
    * Three stages: Working tree vs Staging area (Index) vs Local Repo.
* **Core Git Commands:**
    * Project setup: `init`, `clone`.
    * Basic workflow: `status`, `add`, `commit`, `log`.
    * Inspection: `diff`, `show`.
    * Configuration: `.gitignore`.
* **Branching & Merging Basics:**
    * Branch concept: Why use branches?
    * Merge vs Rebase (The high-level idea).
    * Fast-forward vs no-ff (no-fast-forward).
    * Conflict basics: What causes a conflict?

#### **2. Instruction: How to leverage AI/Web**

* *Sample Prompt:* "Explain Git's internal mental model: Working Directory, Staging Area, and Repository with a real-life analogy."  
* *Sample Prompt:* "What is the difference between Git merge and Git rebase? When should I use each?"  
* *Action:* Once you grasp the concepts, open Mini Labs.md to do **Session 1 Labs**.  
* *Project:* Start **Assignment 01 (Part 1: Local Repo)** in Assignments.md.

### **SESSION 2: PRACTICE LONG ASSIGNMENT (LOCAL TO REMOTE)**

**Goal:** Apply local Git skills and connect to remote repositories.

* **Action:** Follow instructions in **Assignments.md - Assignment 01**.
* **Key tasks:** Create local repo, practice commits with conventions, handle branches, and push to GitHub/GitLab.

---

### **SESSION 3: COLLABORATION WORKFLOW & AGILE SCRUM**

**Goal:** Understand how teams work together using Git and Agile methodologies.

#### **1. Scope**

* **Git Collaboration Workflow:**
    * Git Flow vs Trunk-based Development.
    * Pull Request (PR) / Merge Request (MR) process.
    * Code review basics: Why and How?
    * Undoing changes: `revert` vs `reset`.
* **Agile & Scrum Fundamentals:**
    * Agile mindset: 4 values, 12 principles.
    * Scrum Roles: Product Owner (PO), Scrum Master (SM), Developers.
    * Scrum Artifacts: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment.
    * Scrum Events: Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective.
* **From Backlog to Git:**
    * User Story format: "As a [user], I want to [action] so that [benefit]".
    * Definition of Ready (DoR) vs Definition of Done (DoD).
    * Branch naming conventions from tickets (e.g., `feature/JIRA-123-login`).
    * Linking Commits & PRs to tickets/tasks.

#### **2. Instruction: How to leverage AI/Web**

* *Keywords:* "Git Flow vs Trunk-based comparison", "Scrum guide summary", "User story writing best practices".  
* *Sample Prompt:* "Explain the 4 Scrum events and their goals. How does a developer participate in each?"  
* *Action:* Practice immediately with **Session 3 Labs** in the Mini Labs file.  
* *Project:* Start **Assignment 02 (Part 1: Agile Planning)**.

---

### **SESSION 4: PRACTICE LONG ASSIGNMENT (TEAM WORKFLOW)**

**Goal:** Simulate a team environment with backlogs, branches, and code reviews.

* **Action:** Follow instructions in **Assignments.md - Assignment 02**.
* **Key tasks:** Form a team (3–4 members), create a mini-backlog, follow the full Git workflow (Branch -> Commit -> PR), perform **Peer Code Reviews**, and simulate/resolve **Multi-user Merge Conflicts**.
