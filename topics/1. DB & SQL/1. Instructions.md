# **SELF-LEARNING GUIDE: DATABASE & SQL FUNDAMENTALS (INSTRUCTION)**

Target Audience: Intern Developer/Data Engineer  
Format: Self-learning (Independent Research) & Mentor Review  
Duration: 4 hours/session

## **I. TRAINING PHILOSOPHY & METHODOLOGY**

This program does not follow a "spoon-feeding" approach. We provide **keywords**, **scope**, and **problems**. Your task is to:

1. **Research:** Use AI (ChatGPT, Gemini...) to explain concepts. Use Google/Docs to verify information.  
2. **Synthesize:** Summarize knowledge in your own understanding (Mindmap, Notes).  
3. **Experiment:** Perform **Mini Labs** (separate file) to verify theories immediately.  
4. **Practice:** Apply knowledge to a real-world project in **Assignments** (separate file).

### **Daily Report Structure (Deliverables)**

At the end of each session, you must submit a report to your Mentor using the following template:

**REPORT: [Session Name] - [Date]**

**1. Summary of Learning:**

* Summary of learned concepts (Mindmap/Bullet points).

**2. Mini-Labs Results:**

* Screenshots or code snippets of Lab results.  
* Brief comments (e.g., "This query runs faster because...").

**3. Assignment Results:**

* Report on Assignment progress (Current task, % completion).
* Assignment deliverables (Attachments, links, screenshots).

**4. Issues & Q&A:**

* Problems encountered.
* Questions requiring Mentor's explanation, **at least 3**.

## **II. LEARNING ROADMAP & KNOWLEDGE SCOPE**

### **SESSION 1: DATABASE DESIGN THINKING (DATABASE DESIGN & ERD)**

**Goal:** Understand the nature of RDBMS and design a normalized data model.

#### **1. Scope (Key Knowledge Areas)**

* **Concepts:** RDBMS vs NoSQL, Primary Key (PK), Foreign Key (FK), Unique, Not Null.  
* **Modeling:** Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) - 1-1, 1-n, n-n relationships.  
* **Normalization:** 1NF, 2NF, 3NF forms. When is Denormalization needed?

#### **2. Instruction: How to leverage AI/Web**

* *Sample Prompt:* "Explain the 3 normal forms in database normalization using a Student and Class management example."  
* *Sample Prompt:* "Guide me to draw an ERD for a Library Management System (Books, Authors, Borrowers) using MermaidJS syntax."  
* *Action:* Once you grasp the concepts, open Mini Labs.md to do **Session 1 Labs**.  
* *Project:* Start **Assignment 01 (Part 1: Architect)** in Assignments.md.

### **SESSION 2: DDL & DML - DATA MANIPULATION**

**Goal:** Proficiently write scripts to create tables, and insert, update, and delete data.

#### **1. Scope**

* **Data Types:** VARCHAR vs NVARCHAR, DATETIME vs TIMESTAMP, DECIMAL (for currency) vs FLOAT.  
* **DDL:** CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE (ADD/DROP Column), DROP, TRUNCATE.  
* **DML:** INSERT (Bulk insert), UPDATE, DELETE (Soft delete vs Hard delete).

#### **2. Instruction: How to leverage AI/Web**

* *Keywords:* "SQL Server data types mapping", "Soft delete pattern SQL implementation".  
* *Sample Prompt:* "Write a script to create an Employees table with constraints: Salary cannot be negative, Email must be unique."  
* *Action:* Practice immediately with **Session 2 Labs** in the Mini Labs file.  
* *Project:* Complete **Assignment 01 (Part 2: Implementation)**.

### **SESSION 3: DATA QUERYING & REPORTING**

**Goal:** Understand table joining mechanisms (Join) and data aggregation.

#### **1. Scope**

* **Joins:** INNER JOIN (Intersection), LEFT JOIN (Priority to left table), RIGHT JOIN.  
* **Aggregation:** COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN accompanied by GROUP BY and HAVING.  
* **Logical:** CASE WHEN, IN, BETWEEN, LIKE.

#### **2. Instruction: How to leverage AI/Web**

* *Issues to explore:* Difference between WHERE and HAVING? Why does COUNT(*) differ from COUNT(column_name) when NULLs exist?  
* *Sample Prompt:* "Create dummy data for Customers and Orders tables. Write a query to find customers who have never made a purchase (Use LEFT JOIN)."  
* *Action:* Practice immediately with **Session 3 Labs**.  
* *Project:* Start **Assignment 02 (Part 1: Analytics)**.

### **SESSION 4: ADVANCED TOPICS (INDEX, PROCEDURE, TRANSACTION)**

**Goal:** Experiment with performance and data integrity.

#### **1. Scope**

* **Index:** Clustered vs Non-Clustered Index. Trade-offs when using Index (Fast Read vs Slow Write).  
* **Transaction:** ACID properties. COMMIT, ROLLBACK commands.  
* **Stored Procedure:** Encapsulating business logic in the DB.

#### **2. Instruction: How to leverage AI/Web**

* *Keywords:* "SQL Transaction example bank transfer", "Database Indexing best practices", "SQL Injection prevention".  
* *Sample Prompt:* "Explain ACID in Database Transactions with a money transfer example."  
* *Action:* Practice immediately with **Session 4 Labs**.  
* *Project:* Complete **Assignment 02 (Part 2: Advanced Logic)**.
