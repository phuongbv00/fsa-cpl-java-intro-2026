Duration: 4 hours/session

## **I. TRAINING PHILOSOPHY & METHODOLOGY**

This program does not follow a "spoon-feeding" approach. We provide **keywords**, **scope**, and **problems**. Your task is to:

1. **Research:** Use AI (ChatGPT, Gemini...) to explain concepts. Use Google/Docs to verify information.
2. **Synthesize:** Summarize knowledge in your own understanding (Mindmap, Notes).
3. **Experiment:** Perform **Mini Labs** (separate file) to verify theories immediately.
4. **Practice:** Apply knowledge to solve problems in **Assignments** (separate file).

### **Daily Report Structure (Deliverables)**

Only required for Theory sessions (SS1, SS2, SS4, SS7, SS8).
Assignment sessions (SS3, SS5, SS9) deliver code.
