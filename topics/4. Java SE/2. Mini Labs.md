# **MINI LABS: QUICK PRACTICE EXERCISES**

Purpose: Small, isolated labs to help you verify the theories learned in the Instruction file before applying them to the large project.  
Requirement: After completing each lab, save the screenshot or code snippet to include in your daily report.

### **SESSION 1 LABS: JVM & MAVEN**

**Lab 1.1 (Stack vs Heap):**

- **Task:** Write a program that creates a large object (e.g., massive array) and causes an `OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space`.
- **Then:** Write a recursive method with no base case to cause a `StackOverflowError`.
- **Question:** Which memory area does `new int[1000000]` occupy? Which area tracks the recursive method calls?

**Lab 1.2 (Maven Journey):**

- **Task:** Manually create a Maven project structure without using an IDE wizard (create folders `src/main/java`, `pom.xml`, etc.).
- **Action:** Run `mvn package`. Verify the `target` folder is created.
- **Action:** Run `mvn clean`. Verify `target` is removed.

**Lab 1.3 (Dependencies):**

- **Task:** Add `lombok` or `commons-lang3` to `pom.xml`.
- **Action:** Use a class from that library in your code.
- **Experiment:** Change scope to `test` and try to compile your main code. What happens?

### **SESSION 2 LABS: SYNTAX & OOP**

**Lab 2.1 (Clean Code):**

- **Task:** Take a messy code snippet (provided by AI or yourself) with bad naming (e.g., variable `a`, `x`), deep nesting, and no comments.
- **Action:** Refactor it to follow Java Naming Conventions and improve readability.

**Lab 2.2 (Polymorphism):**

- **Task:** Create an interface `Notification` with method `send(String msg)`. Implement `EmailNotification` and `SMSNotification`.
- **Action:** Create a `List<Notification>` containing both types. Loop through and call `send()`.
- **Observation:** Notice how the correct method is called at runtime.

**Lab 2.3 (Pass-by-Value):**

- **Task:** Write a method `modify(int x, Person p)`. Inside, do `x = x + 1` and `p = new Person("New")`.
- **Action:** Call this method from main. Print variables after call.
- **Question:** Did the original integer change? Did the original Person reference change?

### **SESSION 4 LABS: COLLECTIONS & STREAMS**

**Lab 4.1 (Equals & HashCode):**

- **Task:** Create a class `User` with field `id`. Do NOT implement `equals/hashCode`.
- **Action:** Put two `User` objects with same `id` into a `HashSet`. Check size.
- **Fix:** Generates `equals` and `hashCode`. Repeat. Check size.

**Lab 4.2 (Stream Pipeline):**

- **Task:** Given a list of names: `["John", "Jane", "Adam", "Eve"]`.
- **Action:** Use Stream API to:
  1. Filter names starting with 'J'.
  2. Convert to Uppercase.
  3. Collect into a List.

**Lab 4.3 (Exception Handling):**

- **Task:** Write a method that reads a non-existent file.
- **experiment:**
  1. Use `try-catch` to handle `FileNotFoundException` and print a friendly message.
  2. Modify method to `throws IOException` and handle it in `main`.

### **SESSION 7 LABS: JDBC**

**Lab 7.1 (SQL Injection):**

- **Task:** Create a table `users` (username, password). Insert a value.
- **Action:** Write a raw `Statement` query: `"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '" + input + "'"`
- **Hack:** Input `' OR '1'='1`. Verify it returns data it shouldn't.
- **Fix:** Switch to `PreparedStatement`. Verify the hack fails.

**Lab 7.2 (Resources):**

- **Task:** Write a JDBC code block WITHOUT `try-with-resources`.
- **Question:** Where must you close the Connection? (Hint: `finally` block). What if the `close()` throws an exception?

---

### **SESSION 8 LABS: I/O & THREADS**

**Lab 8.1 (File NIO):**

- **Task:** Create a text file `data.txt`.
- **Action:** Use `Files.readAllLines(Path)` to read it into a List.
- **Action:** Use `Files.write(Path, List)` to write to a new file `copy.txt`.

**Lab 8.2 (Race Condition):**

- **Task:** Create a class `Counter` with `int count = 0` and method `increment() { count++; }`.
- **Action:** Create 2 Threads that run `increment()` 1000 times each on the SAME Counter object.
- **Result:** Print final count. Is it 2000? If not, why?
- **Fix:** Add `synchronized` to the method. Retry.
